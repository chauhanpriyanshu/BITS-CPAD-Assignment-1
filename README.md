### Assignment Task
###### Recently the Government of India has given permission to vaccinate the school going children under age of eighteen with the Covid vaccination. The government is also thinking to manage this effort at the school level as it will be easier to track and manage the vaccination drive progress. Also parents will be assured about the safety of the ward as all the students belonging to a particular school will be vaccinated in the one go providing a safe learning environment for all. 

### Assignment Objective
To create working prototype of cross-platform application (involving both frontend and backend components with interactions between them) for the specified user stories using the technologies / frameworks discussed in the classroom sessions

## Features

- As React Native is a cross-platform framework, the application can be used on Android and iOS devices
- Additionally, there's also support to run the application over web
- Application features authentication and CRUD based operations over student and drive details
- The Dashboard also features the analytics, showing the count of total students, total vaccinated and unvaccinated students

## Tech

School Vaccination Tracker uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) - Build one project that runs natively on all your users' devices!
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - Create native apps for Android, iOS, and more using React
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A Predictable State Container for JS Apps
- [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) - An intuitive Redux side effect manager

## Installation
